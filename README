Description:
    * An implementation of Pacman using several Arduinos.


Included files:
    * cbuffer.cpp
    * color.cpp
    * entities.cpp
    * game.cpp
    * grid.cpp
    * input.cpp
    * main.cpp
    * map.cpp
    * multi.cpp
    * screen.cpp
    
    * include/comm.h
    * include/entities.h
    * include/game.h
    * include/grid.h
    * include/input.h
    * include/map.h
    * include/misc.h
    * include/multi.h
    * include/screen.h
    * include/vector.h



Wiring Instructions:
    Buttons:
    * Arduino Pin 51 -> Right Button
    * Arduino Pin 49 -> Down Button
    * Arduino Pin 47 -> Up Button
    * Arduino Pin 45 -> Left Button

    Server:
    * RXn -> TX1 (client)
    * TXn -> RX1 (client)
    * where n is the port selected (can be 1, 2, 3)

    Server select pin:
    * 53 -> GND (for client config)
    * 53 -> 560 Ohm Resistor -> 5v (for server config)


Compiling and Running Instructions:
    1. Open the terminal in root folder.
    2. Compile and upload the files by running "make upload".
    3. Ensure clients are running before server starts (otherwise the server will timeout the clients)
